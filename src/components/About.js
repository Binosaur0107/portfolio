      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I’m Arvy Lacampuenga, 20 years old (born Feb 26, 2005), and I’m currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Pamantasan ng Cabuyao.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m really into UI/UX design — I love crafting simple, clean, and easy-to-use interfaces that people actually enjoy using.
